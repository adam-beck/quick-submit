This is a small project that will eventually lead to a blog post for [https://codelobe.io](https://codelobe.io). In it we set up a small hapi server
and a react application that allows the user to send data to the server. There is no user authentication at this stage but will more than likely be
written up as well.

### Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
